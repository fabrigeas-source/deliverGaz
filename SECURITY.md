- **Coordinate disclosure**: Work together on appropriate disclosure timelines
- **Learn and improve**: Use reported vulnerabilities to improve our security practices

## Security Tools and Practices

We use various tools and practices to maintain security:

### Backend Security
- **Helmet.js**: For setting various HTTP headers
- **Rate limiting**: To prevent abuse
- **Input validation**: Using libraries like Joi or express-validator
- **CORS**: Properly configured cross-origin resource sharing
- **Environment variables**: For sensitive configuration
- **Dependency scanning**: Regular checks for vulnerable dependencies

### Frontend Security
- **HTTPS enforcement**: All communications use HTTPS
- **Certificate pinning**: For mobile app security
- **Secure storage**: Using platform-specific secure storage for sensitive data
- **Code obfuscation**: For release builds

### Infrastructure Security
- **Regular updates**: Operating systems and software are kept updated
- **Firewalls**: Properly configured network security
- **Monitoring**: Security monitoring and alerting
- **Backup encryption**: Encrypted backups with proper access controls
